## Hobbies

I care about making technology a more inclusive space, and try to read as much as I can on this subject. I'm also interested in the open source movement, and digital privacy in our increasingly surveilled world. 

I love learning languages, playing sports, and making music of all kinds. üé∏ü•Å üéπ
