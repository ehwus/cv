## Alex Withington-Smith
üëã I was the commercial co-founder at *BibliU*. Working with devs reignited an old drive to learn to code, which I've been doing since leaving in January 2020.

Joining an early stage start up taught me to pursue the difficult things, and to learn from my failures. I'm learning to code in this spirit, with a strong sense of curiosity, empathy, and ambition.

To learn, I've been following the [Open Source Society University](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science) CS degree and the [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). I recently enrolled at [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/about-us/), Europe's leading Full Stack development boot camp.

## Hobbies

I care about making technology a more inclusive space, and try to read as much as I can on this subject. I'm also interested in the open source movement, and digital privacy in our increasingly surveilled world. 

I love learning languages, playing sports, and making music of all kinds. üé∏ü•Å üéπ
